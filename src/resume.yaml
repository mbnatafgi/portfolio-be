        accomplishments:
          - "Adopted API-first approach that increased API maturity which reduced repetitive modifications and allowed rapid frontend integration through server-mocking tools."
          - "Embraced OpenAPI for documentation, server-code generation, and client-code generation which vastly boosted the initiation and modification of the micro-service-based APIs."
          - "Designed structural and naming patterns for OpenAPI documents which sidestepped the generator’s compatibility issues and eased the process of using the generated SDKs."
          - "Designed the monolithic repository structure for the micro-services, along with Git's branching technique, in addition to merging and committing conventions which resulted in agile and consistent versioning control."
          - "Implemented Pythonic patterns, such as decorators, along with dozens of helper functions that largely impacted code’s consistency, readability, and structure, and alleviated the team’s development process in various challenging occasions."
          - "Developed a plethora of bash scripts that automated the process of generating, running, building, and deploying the services along with initializing and seeding the database which enormously facilitated the development process for the backend team and the integration and testing process for the frontend team with the help of Docker containers."
          - "Used Setuptools for packaging code that is shared not only by the micro-services, but also by the bash scripts which enhanced and eased the process of managing, applying and extending those scripts."
          - "Secured the source code using code obfuscation and bundling tools like PyInstaller."
          - "Adopted Kubernetes as an orchestration tool for the solution to achieve high scalability and availability, rolling updates, and service discovery."
          - "Designed and implemented an Instance Manager as an interface with either Kubernetes cluster or Docker daemon such that it can be queried by internal services to discover and communicate with others and to spin up new ones for increased parallelism."
          - "Implemented RSA signing and public key storage for secure micro-service authentication and authorization on Dev, Docker, and Kubernetes deployments."
